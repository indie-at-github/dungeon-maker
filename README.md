# Dungeon Maker

Dungeon Maker is a simple dungeon generator, using cellular automata.
I got the idea for it once I saw the fantastic cave tiles created by [Clint Bellanger](https://opengameart.org/content/cave-tileset)

## JSON Configuration
Almost all configurations for displaying the maps are on the file ```maprepresentation.json```

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thanks:
  * Wenzel Jakob: for creating [nanogui](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui)
  * Niels Lohmann: for creating [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
  * [Clint Bellanger](https://opengameart.org/content/cave-tileset): for the tile set

## Compilation
Both nanogui and json are submodules. There should be no problem compiling using cmake.
